# Tasks App



As Tasks App is a tool designed to teach you about the Slack Platform, we don't currently offer a hosted version. If you're looking for a project management tool for your organisation, check out the many options available on our [App Directory](https://my.slack.com/apps/category/At0EFY3MJ4-project-management).

If you want to see the app in action, there's some screenshots below, or you can clone the repo and run it locally.
